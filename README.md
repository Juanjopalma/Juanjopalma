# Hello world!, I'm Juanjo
### FullStack Web Developer || Industrial Engineer 

💻 I am Full Stack Web Developer. I studied Industrial Engineering where I discovered programming and was able to find my true calling. To complement my background, I completed intensive training in cutting-edge technologies in the IT world.

🛠 My technology stack is:
- Front: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Angular and Bootstrap.
- Back: Java and Node.js
- Database: MySQL

👨‍💻I'm trying to do my best at SDG Group as a developer. We work in agile, applying good practices and as it is an international project I have the opportunity to improve my English, in addition to the technical part.
